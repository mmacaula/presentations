	            Promises in Javascript
	          </a>
	        </h2>
	        <p>Promises in Javascript are great!  They help you get out of "callback hell" and let you wrangle asynchronous code easily.  This talk will provide a quick introduction to promises in Javascript, why they are useful, show you how to use them, and discuss some common pitfalls to avoid when using promises.  </p>

	            Reinvigorate your Backbone Application
	          </a>
	        </h2>
	        <p>Got a backbone app?  Feel like you've been left behind in the past 2 years by Angular/Ember/React?  Wish you could check out one of them but feel stuck with Backbone?  This talk will explain why you should be glad you went with such a flexible library to base your application on.  I'll show how backbone's flexibility gives your apps a consistent upgrade path and allows you to continually reinvigorate your application, without a full re-write!

  	            Using Custom Elements Today
  	          </a>
  	        </h2>
  	        <p>The Web Components Revolution is upon us! Too bad Safari and IE haven’t gotten the memo yet. With silence on whether they will be implementing important parts of the Web Components spec like Shadow DOM, it makes you wonder if we’ll ever be able to use them in our code without large complex polyfills.
  	        </p><p> However, one part of the Web Components spec is ready to go today! Custom Elements require only a 4k polyfill, work on IE9+ and add a standard, reusable way to create your own tags and add some behavior to them. Are they going to change web development as we know it? No, but are they an important tool that can solve some problems in an elegant way? Definitely. I’ll talk about how you can use and create your own Custom Elements and show some problems that lend themselves easily to being solved by custom elements.
